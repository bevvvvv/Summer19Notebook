# Polynomial Interpolation

In this chapter we study how to interpolate a data set with a polynomial.

**Problem Description**: Given (n+1) points, say(x~i~, y~i~), where i = 0,1,2,...,n, with distinct
x~i~, not necessarily sorted, we want to find a polynomial of degree n:

\[
P_n(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_1x+a_0
\]

such that it interpolates these points, i.e.,

\[
P_n(x)= y_i, i = 0,1,2,...,n
\]

The goal is the determine the coefficients $a_n, a_{n-1},...,a_1,a_0$. Note the total number of data poitns
is 1 larger than the degree of the polynomial.

Why should we do this?

* Find the values between the points for discrete data set
* To approximate a (probably complicated) function by a polynomial
* Then, it is easier to do computations such as derivative, integrations, etc...

## Van Der Monde Matrix Example

Interpolate the given data set with a polynomial of degree 2:

$$
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|}
x$_i$ & 0 & 1 & 2/3\\
y$_i$ & 1 & 0 & 0.5
\end{tabular}
$$

**Answer** Let

\[
P_2(x) = a_2x^2 + a_1x+ a_0
\]

We need to find the coefficients $a_2, a_1, a_0$.
By the interpolating properties, we have 3 equations:

\[x = 0, y = 1 : P_2(0) = a_0 = 1\]
\[x = 1, y = 0 : P_2(1) = a_2+a_1+a_0 = 0\]
\[x = \frac23, y = 0.5 : P_2(\frac23) = (\frac49)a_2+(\frac23)a_1+a_0=0.5\]

Here we have 3 linear equations and 3 unknowns ($a_2, a_1, a_0$).


The equations:

\[a_0 = 1\]
\[a_2 + a_1 = 0\]
\[\frac49a_2+\frac23a_1+a_0=0.5\]

In matrix-vector form:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 
0 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1\\
\frac49 & \frac23 & 1
\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{c} 
a_2 \\
a_1 \\
a_0
\end{array}\right) =
\left(\begin{array}{c}
1 \\
0 \\
0.5
\end{array}\right)
$$

Easy to solve in Matlab, or do it by hand:

\[a_2 = -\frac34\]
\[a_1 = -\frac14\]
\[a_0 = 1\]

Then

\[P_2(x) = -\frac34x^2 -\frac14x + 1\]

### The general case

![](./Media/VanDerMondeGeneral.png)

* X: a (n+1) x (n+1) matrix, given (Van Der Monde matrix)
* a: unknown vector, with length (n + 1)
* y: given vector, with length (n + 1)

**Theorem** If x~i~'s are distinct, then X is invertible, therefore a has a unique solution.

In Matlab, the command vander(x), where x is a vector that contains the interpolation points
x = [$x_1, x_2, ...,x_n$], will generate this matrix.

Bad News: X has a very large condition number for large n, therefore not effective to solve if n is large.
